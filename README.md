# pole-roulette
 I want to be able to create a game that will pick random moves,
the goal is help students create combos in their own style,
it's also to help freestyling.
Things  I need to consider: 
1. Level of student in pole.
2. Add a challenge in emotion
3. add a movement. Example: add a "twizzle if possible,""use arms", "use head" 
4. create a modified variation of easy, medium, hard, expert mode
